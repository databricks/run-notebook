# databricks/run-notebook v0

# Overview
Given a Databricks notebook and cluster specification, this Action runs the notebook as a one-time Databricks Job
run (docs: 
[AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/jobs.html#operation/JobsRunsSubmit) |
[Azure](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/_static/api-refs/jobs-2.1-azure.yaml#operation/JobsRunsSubmit) |
[GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/jobs.html#operation/JobsRunsSubmit)) and awaits its completion:

- optionally installing libraries on the cluster before running the notebook
- optionally configuring permissions on the notebook run (e.g. granting other users permission to view results)
- optionally triggering the Databricks job run with a timeout
- optionally using a Databricks job run name
- setting the notebook output,
  job run ID, and job run page URL as Action output
- failing if the Databricks job run fails

You can use this Action to trigger code execution on Databricks for CI (e.g. on pull requests) or CD (e.g. on pushes
to master).  

# Prerequisites
To use this Action, you need a Databricks REST API token to trigger notebook execution and await completion. The API
token must be associated with a principal with the following permissions:
* Cluster permissions ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/security/access-control/cluster-acl.html#types-of-permissions) |
[Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/security/access-control/cluster-acl#types-of-permissions) |
[GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/security/access-control/cluster-acl.html)): Allow unrestricted cluster creation entitlement,
if running the notebook against a new cluster (recommended), or "Can restart" permission, if running the notebook
against an existing cluster.
* Workspace permissions ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/security/access-control/workspace-acl.html#folder-permissions) |
[Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/security/access-control/workspace-acl#--folder-permissions) |
[GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/security/access-control/workspace-acl.html#folder-permissions)):
  * If supplying `local-notebook-path` with one of the `git-commit`, `git-tag`, or `git-branch` parameters, no workspace
    permissions are required. However, your principal must have Git integration configured ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/gitcredentials.html#operation/create-git-credential) | [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/api/latest/gitcredentials) | [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/gitcredentials.html#operation/create-git-credential)). You can associate git credentials with your principal by creating a git credential entry using your principal's API token.
  * If supplying the `local-notebook-path` parameter, "Can manage" permissions on the directory specified by the
    `workspace-temp-dir` parameter (the `/tmp/databricks-github-actions` directory if `workspace-temp-dir` is unspecified).
  * If supplying the `workspace-notebook-path`  parameter, "Can read" permissions on the specified notebook.

We recommend that you store the Databricks REST API token in [GitHub Actions secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)
to pass it into your GitHub Workflow. The following section lists recommended approaches for token creation by cloud.

Note: we recommend that you do not run this Action against workspaces with IP restrictions. GitHub-hosted action runners have a [wide range of IP addresses](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#ip-addresses), making it difficult to whitelist.

## AWS
For security reasons, we recommend creating and using a Databricks service principal API token. You can
[create a service principal](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/scim/scim-sp.html#create-service-principal),
grant the Service Principal
[token usage permissions](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/access-control/tokens.html#control-who-can-use-or-create-tokens),
and [generate an API token](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/token-management.html#operation/create-obo-token) on its behalf.

## Azure
For security reasons, we recommend using a Databricks service principal AAD token.

### Create an Azure Service Principal
Here are two ways that you can create an Azure Service Principal. 

The first way is via the Azure Portal UI. See the [Azure Databricks documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals#create-a-service-principal). Record the Application (client) Id, Directory (tenant) Id, and client secret values generated by the steps.

The second way is via the Azure CLI. You can follow the instructions below:
* Install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
* Run `az login` to authenticate with Azure
* Run `az ad sp create-for-rbac -n <your-service-principal-name> --sdk-auth --scopes /subscriptions/<azure-subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name> --sdk-auth --role contributor`,
  specifying the subscription and resource group of your Azure Databricks workspace, to create a service principal and client secret.

From the resulting JSON output, record the following values:
* `clientId`: this is the client or application Id of your service principal.
* `clientSecret`: this is the client service of your service princiapl.
* `tenantId`: this is the tenant or directory Id of your service principal.

After you create an Azure Service Principal, you should add it to your Azure Databricks workspace using the [SCIM API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/api/latest/scim/scim-sp#add-service-principal). Use the client or application Id of your service principal as the `applicationId` of the service principal in the `add-service-principal` payload.

### Use the Service Principal in your GitHub Workflow
* Store your service principal credentials into your GitHub repository secrets. The Application (client) Id should be stored as `AZURE_SP_APPLICATION_ID`, Directory (tenant) Id as `AZURE_SP_TENANT_ID`, and client secret as `AZURE_SP_CLIENT_SECRET`.
* Add the following step at the start of your GitHub workflow.
  This will create a new AAD token for your Azure Service Principal and save its value in the `DATABRICKS_TOKEN`
  environment variable for use in subsequent steps.

  ```yaml
  - name: Generate AAD Token
    run: |
      echo "DATABRICKS_TOKEN=$(curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
        https://login.microsoftonline.com/${{ secrets.AZURE_SP_TENANT_ID }}/oauth2/v2.0/token \
        -d 'client_id=${{ secrets.AZURE_SP_APPLICATION_ID }}' \
        -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
        -d 'scope=2ff814a6-3304-4ab8-85cb-cd0e6f879c1d%2F.default' \
        -d 'client_secret=${{ secrets.AZURE_SP_CLIENT_SECRET }}' |  jq -r  '.access_token')" >> $GITHUB_ENV
  ```
**Notes**:
  * The generated Azure token has a default life span of **60 minutes**.
  If you expect your Databricks notebook to take longer than 60 minutes to finish executing, then you must create a [token lifetime policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/configure-token-lifetimes)
  and attach it to your service principal.
  * The generated Azure token will work across all workspaces that the Azure Service Principal is added to. You do not need to generate a token for each workspace.

## GCP
For security reasons, we recommend inviting a service user to your Databricks workspace and using their API token.
You can invite a [service user to your workspace](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/administration-guide/users-groups/users.html#add-a-user),
log into the workspace as the service user, and [create a personal access token](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/authentication.html) 
to pass into your GitHub Workflow.
  
# Usage

### Run a notebook using library dependencies in the current repo and on PyPI
In the workflow below, we build Python code in the current repo into a wheel, use ``upload-dbfs-temp`` to upload it to a
tempfile in DBFS, then run a notebook that depends on the wheel, in addition to other libraries publicly available on
PyPI. 

Databricks supports a range of library types, including Maven and CRAN. See 
the docs
([Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/api/latest/libraries#--library) |
[AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/libraries.html#library) |

### Run notebook within a temporary checkout of the current Repo
The workflow below runs a notebook within a temporary repo checkout, enabled by
specifying the  `git-commit`, `git-branch`, or `git-tag` parameter. You can use this to run notebooks that
depend on other notebooks or files (e.g. Python modules in `.py` files) within the same repo.
In the future, this will be our recommended approach for running notebooks using library dependencies in the
current repo.

```yaml
name: Run a notebook within its repo on PRs

on:
  pull_request

env:
  DATABRICKS_HOST: https://adb-XXXX.XX.azuredatabricks.net

jobs:
  build:

            }
          # Grant all users view permission on the notebook results

            [

              }

```

### Run notebooks in different Databricks Workspaces
In this example, we supply the `databricks-host` and `databricks-token` inputs
to each `databricks/run-notebook` step to trigger notebook execution against different workspaces.
The tokens are read from the GitHub repository secrets, `DATABRICKS_DEV_TOKEN` and `DATABRICKS_STAGING_TOKEN` and `DATABRICKS_PROD_TOKEN`.

Note that for Azure workspaces, you simply need to generate an AAD token once and use it across all
workspaces.

```yaml
name: Run a notebook in the current repo on pushes to main

```

# Troubleshooting
To enable debug logging for Databricks REST API requests (e.g. to inspect the payload of a bad `/api/2.0/jobs/runs/submit`
Databricks REST API request), you can set the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` action secret to
`true`.
See [Step Debug Logs](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-debugging.md#how-to-access-step-debug-logs) 
for further details.
